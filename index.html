My name is Carlos Rivera, born in Ecuador raised in the U.S, graduated from Upper Darby High school ,Associate degree at Delaware County Community College for a career in the health industry but realized that technology/programming was the career I wanted to persue.
Attended Bloomsburg University of PA for computer science then later on I studied programming languages on my own for almost a year before decided to attend to a coding BootCamp to expand my knowledge and as well get mentorship from prfessionals with more expierence on this field
